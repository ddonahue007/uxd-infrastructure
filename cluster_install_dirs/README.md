# Cluster Installation Directories

    These directories represent a cluster that has been deployed onto the UXD Openstack Infrastructure.
    
    cluster_install_dirs/<cluster_name>/

    When running the the create-install script it will build out a directory matching your cluster name.
    It is important to push this directory and its contents to this repository. Having these as shared 
    install-dirs will give the ability of updating/deleting the cluster to anyone and not just the 
    person that did the initial installation.
